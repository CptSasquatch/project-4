### Project Description/Outline

We will be using machine learning to predict the price index(Jan 2000=100) of houses in the US housing market using a random forest regression model from sklearn as well as a time series model using pyaf. As part of our analysis, we will be looking at the following:

* How well does the model predict the price index of houses in the US housing market?
* What are the most important features in predicting the price index of houses in the US housing market?
* How well does the time series model predict the price index of houses in the US housing market?
* Compare the results of the random forest regression model and the time series model.
